    A crack in the world
    Light pulled through the ether
    Drawing cuts in the deep blue sky
    When do I crack?
    From the shame?
    From the blame?
    Pills
    Devoid of will
    Kill
    When does it end?
    Foul mouth
    Perjury
    When did God leave
    On the fields of poppy?
    On the will of fathers?
    Burning afar
    I see those
    Specters
    In my mind
    heroes
    In the eyes of those
    Who did not leave a part
    Of themselves
    On every muddy
    Earthen tomb
    Subsumed War
    In my head
    For me
    In that train car
    The war never ended
    Their words a siren call
    When hope was dead
    And could no longer hear
    Perched on the shattered
    Will of my being
    Sits a demon
    Pills
    Devoid of will
    Kill
    When does it end?
    When did God leave
    On the floor of my home?
    Revolver smoke
    We were never “broken”
    As I lay my life bleeding
    Away
    I feel the weight
    Of all those
    Sons
    Fathers
    Brothers
    I was never destined for God
    A crack in the world
    Light pulled through the ether
    Drawing cuts in the deep blue sky
    When do I crack?
    When do I crack?
